     **Properties:** Vertices are reported in topological ordering, i.e. a linear
     ordering of the vertices such that for every directed edge *uv* from vertex *u* to
     vertex *v* ("*u* depends on *v*"), *v* comes before *u* in the ordering. If the

     RuntimeError exception is raised and a cyclic path from a start vertex is provided.

+    Vertices are expanded following the strategy `nographs.TraversalDepthFirst`.

+    (see search state) or if it is a start vertex. Note this difference in comparison
+    to other traversals that mark a vertex as visited when it is reported.
 
     **Input:** Directed graph. One or more start vertices. Vertices must be
     hashable, or hashable id can be provided. Unlabeled or labeled edges. Optional
     calculation limit.
 
     **Search state:** When a vertex is

     A heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from a given
     vertex to the goal (resp. to any of your goal vertices, if you have more than
     one), and never overestimates the actual needed costs ("admissible heuristic

-    length (sum of edge weights) of the shortest path from a start vertex to the

+    **Properties:** Vertices are reported and expanded ordered by increasing path
+    length (sum of edge weights) of the shortest paths from a start vertex to the
+    respective vertex that have been found so far.
+
+    When the goal is reported, the path stored for it in *paths* is a shortest
+    path from start to goal and the path_length of the search state is the distance
+    of the goal from start.
 
     In case the used heuristic function is *consistent* (i.e., following an edge from
     one vertex to another never reduces the estimated costs to get to the goal by
     more than the weight of the edge), further guarantees hold: Each vertex is only
-    visited once. And for each visited vertex, the yielded path length and edge count
+    visited once. And for each visited vertex, the respective path_length and depth
     (and optionally, the path) are the data of the shortest existing path from start
     (not only from the shortest path found so far).
 
     **Search state:** When a vertex is *expanded* (traversal calls next_edges or
     next_labeled_edges) or *reported* (an iterator of the traversal returns it),
     the traversal provides updated values for the attributes
     *path_length*, *depth*, *paths*.

 **the analysis and the reporting of results by the library happen on the fly**

 **Feature overview**

+- Unidirectional traversal algorithms: DFS, BFS, topological search,
   Dijkstra, A\* and MST.
-- Flexible graph notion: Infinite directed multigraphs with loops and
-  attributes (this includes
-  multiple adjacency, cycles, self-loops,
-  directed edges,
-  weighted edges and edges with application specific attributes).
-  Your vertices can be nearly anything.
-  Wide range of data types for edge weights and path length
-  supported (float, int, Decimal, mpmath.mpf and others), e.g.,
-  for high precision computations.
-  Infinite graphs are supported, but need to be
-  locally finite (i.e., a vertex has only finitely many outgoing edges).
+- Bidirectional search algorithms: BFS and Dijkstra.
+- Flexible graph notion:
+
+  - Infinite directed multigraphs with loops and
+    attributes (this includes
+    multiple adjacency, cycles, self-loops,
+    directed edges,
+    weighted edges and edges with application specific attributes).
+  - Infinite graphs are supported, but need to be
+    locally finite (i.e., a vertex has only finitely many outgoing edges).
+
+- Generic API. The application can define the following:
+
+  - Vertices: Can be anything except for None. Hashable vertices can be
+    used directly, unhashable vertices can be used together with
+    hashable identifiers.
+  - Edge weights and distances: Wide range of data types
+    supported (float, int, Decimal, mpmath.mpf and others), e.g.,
+    for high precision computations.
+  - Edge attributes: Any object, e.g, a container
+    with further data.
+  - Identity and equivalence of vertices.
+  - Bookkeeping: Several sets of bookkeeping data structures
+    are predefined, optimized for different situations (data types used by the
+    application, hashing vs. indexing, collections for *Python* objects or *C* native
+    data types,...); Adaptable and extendable, e.g., specialized
+    collections of 3rd party libraries can be integrated easily and runtime
+    efficiently
+
 - Results: Reachability, depth, distance, paths and trees.
   Paths can be
   calculated with vertices or edges or attributed edges
   and can be iterated in both directions.
 - Flexible API: The concept of implicit graphs that NoGraphs is based on
-  allows for an API that eases operations like
-  graph pruning, graph product and graph abstraction ike
+  allows for an API that eases
+  operations like
   graph pruning, graph abstraction, the typical binary
   graph operations (union, intersection, several types of products), the
   computation of search-aware graphs, and
   traversals of vertex equivalence classes on the fly.
-- Flexible bookkeeping:
-  Several sets of bookkeeping data structures,

+  Bookkeeping data can be
   pre-initialized and accessed during computations.
 - Typing: The API can be used fully typed (optionally).
 - Implementation: Pure Python (>=3.9). It introduces no further dependencies.
 - Runtime and memory performance: Have been goals. In its domain, it
   often even outperforms Rust- and C-based libraries.
